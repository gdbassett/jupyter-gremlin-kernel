# Jupyter Gremlin Kernel

[Apache TinkerPopâ„¢](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).  Tinkerpop Gremlin is a [Graph Transversal Language](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) That can be used to build, manipulate, and query graph structured data accessable through a gremlin server.

The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) gremlin kernel is a Jupyter kernel based on the [Jupyter Groovy Kernel](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel) and [Jupyter LSD Kernel](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-lsd-kernel) that allows the user to use jupyter as a webUI for a gremlin console.

## Installation

### From Source

Building the Jupyter Gremlin Kernel project requires Maven 3.x or higher.
TODO: Do we really need maven?

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/gdbassett/jupyter-gremlin-kernel.git 
$> cd jupyter-gdbassett-kernel
$> mvn package
$> ./install.sh <kernel directory>
```

Where *&lt;kernel directory&gt;* is a directory where the kernel jar file will be copied and can be any directory on your system.

### From Pre-compiled Binaries

Download and expand the [Gremlin Kernel archive TODO](TODO) and then run the *install.sh* script.
TODO: pre-compile kernels

```bash
$> wget https://TODO
$> tar xzf jupyter-germlin-kernel-latest.tgz
$> cd jupyter-gremlin-kernel-x.y.z
$> ./install.sh <kernel directory>
```

Where *&lt;kernel directory&gt;* is a directory where the kernel jar file will be copied and can be any directory on your system. Replace *x.y.z* with the current version number.

### Notes

By default the *install.sh* script will install the Jupyter kernel to the system kernel directory. This is typically */usr/local/share/juptyer* on Linux/MacOS systems and %PROGRAMDATA%\jupyter\kernels on Windows systems.  To install the Jupyter kernel to the User's directory you must either:

* Edit the *install.script* and add the *--user* option to the `kernelspec` command, or
* Edit the kernel.json file to set the *argv* paramater to the location of the Jupyter Groovy kernel and then run the `jupyter kernelspec install` command manually.

You can view the default directories that Jupyter uses by running the command `jupyter --paths`.


## Notebook Functions

The Jupyter Gremlin kernel provides serveral functions to simplify interacting with a Galaxy instance.

TODO: Document functions or point to gremlin documentation.

## Docker

A Docker image containing the gremlin kernel is available from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/TBD).  

Inside the container Jupyter uses the directory */home/jovyan* to save and load notebooks.  To persists notebooks created inside the container mount a local directory as */home/jovyan*.

Until the dockerfile has been uploaded to dockerhub, the following process should build an environment locally:
```bash
$> docker pull tinkerpop/gremlin-server
$> docker run -p 8182:8182 --name gremlin-server-test tinkerpop/gremlin-server
$> cd <project root>
$> cp ./target/jupyter-gremlin-kernel-<kernel version>.jar ./
$> docker build -t jupyter-gremlin-kernel -f ./src/docker/Dockerfile .
$> docker run -p 8888:8888 --name jupyter-gremlin-kernel-c jupyter-gremlin-kernel
```
Connect to https://localhost:8888 and enter the token shown in your console.

TODO: Upload Kernel to docker hub.  Until then below won't work.
```bash
$> VOLUME="-v $HOME/notebooks:/home/jovyan"
$> PORTS="-p 8888:8888"
$> docker run -d $PORTS $ENV $VOLUME gdbassett/jupyter-gremlin-kernel 
```
